# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: There's no progress at all this is just a commit 0. Tomorrow things will get on fire, today's planning xD

**Thoughts:** Every thought I had about it was written down in an article and published on my LinkedIn account. I will leave the link to the article on the next section. Anxious for tomorrow! :)
