**Today's Progress**: There's no progress at all this is just a commit 0. Tomorrow things will get on fire, today's planning xD

**Thoughts:** Every thought I had about it was written down in an article and published on my LinkedIn account. I will leave the link to the article on the next section. Anxious for tomorrow! :)

### Day 1: November 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I started a CSS Pure Image of an Astrounaut -that's not finished yet- and went through tha Frontend course at FreeCodeCamp.org, I also started a Javascript challenge about show the local weather.

**Thoughts:** Today was a really busy and rainy day. I had to leave my notebook at work, that's why I don't have so much to show for today. I really did create simple functions for a calculator in Javascript while I was on the bus, but since I was using my Android fone, the editor app crashed I and lost everything I was doing :( - Tomorrow's gonna be a new day :)
