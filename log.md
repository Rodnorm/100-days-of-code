**Today's Progress**: There's no progress at all this is just a commit 0. Tomorrow things will get on fire, today's planning xD

### Day 1: November 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I started a CSS Pure Image of an Astrounaut -that's not finished yet- and went through tha Frontend course at FreeCodeCamp.org, I also started a Javascript challenge about showing the local weather.

**Thoughts:** Today was a really busy and rainy day. I had to leave my notebook at work, that's why I don't have so much to show for today. I really did create simple functions for a calculator in Javascript while I was on the bus, but since I was using my Android fone, the editor app crashed I and lost everything I was doing :( - Tomorrow's gonna be a new day :)

### Day 2: November 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: In the morning I managed to find some time to finish that weather projet on codepen -I'm not finished with the visuals, though- I also finished the CSS part of the freeCodeCamp course. It's 20h53 and I'm creating a node API to redirect requests with authentication handling, this is way you don't need to implement you authentication on your code. Just request that API. Don't put your hopes up so high as I am still working on it :) now I'm gonna eat hambuguers with my family! Happy Coding to all! <3

**Thoughts:** Today was a AWESOME!
