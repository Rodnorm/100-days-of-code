# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: There's no progress at all this is just a commit 0. Tomorrow things will get on fire, today's planning xD

**Thoughts:** Every thought I had about it was written down in an article and published on my LinkedIn account. I will leave the link to the article on the next section. Anxious for tomorrow! :)

### Day 1: November 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I started a CSS Pure Image of an Astrounaut -that's not finished yet- and went through tha Frontend course at FreeCodeCamp.org, I also started a Javascript challenge about showing the local weather.

**Thoughts:** Today was a really busy and rainy day. I had to leave my notebook at work, that's why I don't have so much to show for today. I really did create simple functions for a calculator in Javascript while I was on the bus, but since I was using my Android fone, the editor app crashed I and lost everything I was doing :( - Tomorrow's gonna be a new day :)

### Day 2: November 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: In the morning I managed to find some time to finish that weather projet on codepen -I'm not finished with the visuals, though- I also finished the CSS part of the freeCodeCamp course. It's 20h53 and I'm creating a node API to redirect requests with authentication handling, this is way you don't need to implement you authentication on your code. Just request that API. Don't put your hopes up so high as I am still working on it :) now I'm gonna eat hambuguers with my family! Happy Coding to all! <3 PS: forgot to say that I even managed to run for 40 minutes today!!

**Thoughts:** Today was a AWESOME!

### Day 3: December 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked mainly on that API I was talking about in the last log. It's not finished yet but many things are already working.

**Thoughts:** I also managed to run -again- for 40 minutes, got a haircut and watched a play in the theater with my fiancee. <3

### Day 4: December 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I'm commiting this on December 3rd - I slept and forgot to do day earlier - Well, I worked on that API and it is finished! I integrated it with another project I've been working on for college, which is a ecommerce in Angular. It's fully integrated now ^^ I only need to adapt some stuff in order for this api to be integrable with different systems. I also started making my blogfolio, I intend to launch it this week! I'd better run, then :)

**Thoughts:** I don't know if I fully agree with the 'Per aspera ad astra' motto but it may apply well in the tech industry, as simplist as it might sound. Regardless of that, I'm enjoying every moment of that.

### Day 5: December 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Well, today I finished the looks of that codepen project about weather forecast I did. I also did a teoric test about Angular. I don't know my results though, I'll be posting here as soon as I know.

**Thoughts:** I found a tutorial to develop a feature I thought was going to be a problem, turns out it is indeed a problem but it isn't that big anymore. I think I can take it :)

**Today's Progress**: Well, I worked mainly in my portfolio website. I'm hosting it on github pages for now.

**Thoughts:** Today I got some amazing news! But I don't think I should tell it today. xD

### Day 7: December 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I got my portfolio working fine. Added one more route to the nodeAuth API. Added localStorage and login/logout from my Angular projet at college. A lot of stuff.
